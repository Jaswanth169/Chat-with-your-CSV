**Chat-with-your-CSV**

The project aims to develop a conversational question-answering system for analyzing CSV data, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

**Key Components:**
1. Libraries and Tools: The project makes use of several Python libraries and tools, including Transformers, Accelerate, BitsAndBytes, Hugging Face Hub, Langchain, PyPDF, Sentence Transformers, FAISS-GPU, and ChromaDB.
2. Model Configuration: It utilizes the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 language model for text generation and conversational interactions. The model is quantized using BitsAndBytes for efficient computation and memory usage.
3. Data Processing: CSV data is loaded and preprocessed using Langchain's CSVLoader. The data is split into chunks for efficient processing using a CharacterTextSplitter.
4. Embeddings and Vectorization: Sentence embeddings are generated using HuggingFaceEmbeddings, and a vector store is created using FAISS for similarity search and retrieval.
5. Conversational Retrieval Chain: A conversational retrieval chain is established using Langchain's ConversationalRetrievalChain. It integrates the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 model with the FAISS retriever for question-answering tasks.
   
**Usage Instructions:**
To use the application, users can input prompts or questions related to the CSV data. The system will provide comprehensive and informative answers based on the input queries, utilizing the Mistral model and the underlying data vectors.

**Implementation Notes:**
The implementation focuses on efficiency, scalability, and accuracy in handling large CSV datasets. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques and machine learning models to deliver robust and insightful analyses.

**Future Enhancements:**
Potential future enhancements include optimizing performance, adding support for additional data formats, and integrating more advanced NLP capabilities for enhanced conversational interactions.

**Contributions and Feedback:**
Contributions and feedback from the open-source community are welcome. Please feel free to contribute to the project, report issues, or suggest improvements to enhance its functionality and usability.
